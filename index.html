                            </span><br>I have successfully completed an online apprenticeship in the field of web development at SLASH MARK and SHRIPRITI EDUCATIONAL, which has been approved by AICTE.
                            During this internship, I learned a lot about the real structure of websites, how they are built, how to make them responsive for different devices, and the distinctions between different websites. Throughout my adventure, I have enjoyed constructing those websites with much pleasure and enthusiasm. Now I can create web sites on my own with good appearance and functionality. These internships were really beneficial to me and provided me with the opportunity to choose my professional path.

                            <li><span>Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)</span><br>The University of Michigan awarded me a certificate for passing the exam.
                                There was a crash course held at my college to prepare for this exam. Throughout that journey, I learnt new things about programming languages and what they can do for humans. So we started from zero and learned the fundamentals, which allowed us to tackle several difficult questions with ease. I discovered that in any language, if you are truly proficient at the basics, you can answer the majority of the questions with little effort. This training truly helped me a lot to obtain hands-on experience on the mother of all programming languages "PYTHON"

                            <li><span>Community Service</span><br>In my academics, I conducted a community service project that increased my communication skills, problem-solving abilities, leadership, team collaboration, presentations, reports, data analysis, and insights. I learned a lot while working on that project. I can't believe I can gain so many talents in one project, and the best part is that the project's team members have become my best friends and stand out from the rest of college, and they are a true blessing to me. I really love them a lot.</li>
